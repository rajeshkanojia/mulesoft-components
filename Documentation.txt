Module Name : Scheduler
Connector and Component used:
	Scheduler
	Object Store
	HTTP
	File
Module Description : 
	In this dummy project I am reading a json file (location : resources/sample-data/user-data.json) which contains user data like.
	{
		"name": "Quinn Jackson",
		"phone": "1-385-262-4786",
		"email": quinnjackson@yopmail.com,
		"address": "P.O. Box 779, 7458 Egestas Av.",
		"postalZip": "23W 7S7",
		"region": "Huáběi",
		"country": "Costa Rica"
	},  

 
    My scheduler fetch single object in every 2 seconds from the file and send it to http://localhost:8081/listener through HTTP Request connector. To track the index number I use Object store. At HTTP Listener connector end which is working as receiver, simply receive the payload and store it in json file with specific country name under resources/output folder.

Important takeaway :
	How scheduler works
	How to maintain state using Object store
